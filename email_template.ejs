    How are you? I'm doing well. It's been almost <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and enjoying my time. This is an auto-generated email I learned how to make in Fullstack Foundations.

    I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack Academy. 
    Check out my most recent posts:
    <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].href %>> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Best,<br>
